The following chapter comprises the main activity of the project: the implementation of the TaWusel webservice and the TaWusel
Android application. At the beginning we take a look at the basic architecture design of the whole service in section
\ref{sec:GArc}. Afterwards the database design is described in a brief section.

Subsequently to the fundamentals the section \ref{sec:Webs} takes a closer look at the implementation of the web service.

Last but not least the focus of section \ref{sec:Andr} will be on the Android application. Here you will find a brief description
of its functions (see \ref{ssec:AndrDes}), some design thoughts regarding the class diagram and a description of the classes which
are used by the app (see \ref{ssec:AndrArc}) as well as an installation guide to run the app on your mobile device (see
\ref{ssec:AndrInst}).

You can retrieve more information if you follow the link to our issue tracker
(\url{https://github.com/nutztherookie/swp_kp2_2012_gruppe1/issues}) Here most of our task which came up while the implementation
are covered. There are also some issues which are labeled with the prefix "wishlist", these are suggestions how one could improve
the service in the future. The whole document with all estimated users stories can be found in appendix \ref{chp:US}.
