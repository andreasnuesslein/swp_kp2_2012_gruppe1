The following chapter comprises the main activity of the project: the implementation of the TaWusel webservice and the TaWusel
Android application. At the beginning we take a look at the basic architecture design of the whole service in section
\ref{sec:GArc}. Afterwards the database design is described in a brief section.

Last but not least the focus of section \ref{sec:Andr} will be on the Android application. Here you will find a brief description
of its functions (see \ref{ssec:AndrDes}), some design thoughts regarding the class diagram and a description of the classes which
are used by the app (see \ref{ssec:AndrArc}) as well as an installation guide to run the app on your mobile device (see
\ref{ssec:AndrInst}).
